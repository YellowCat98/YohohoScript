# YohohoScript

- YohohoScript is just some random language that i made a while back for some reason

- the syntax is ATROCIOUS!!!

```
[PRINT] "Hello, World!" [END]
[ADDSTR] "this doesnt even work lol and it just " "prints the output" [END]
[AWAIT] 20 [END]
[PRINT] "After 20 seconds..."
[HALT]
```
- ^ halt doesnt do anything except exit the program (there are no if statements)

(adding variables maybe soon idk no promises)


# COMPILING THIS THINGY!!!!

c++ compiler
cmake
